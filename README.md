# Rust-Learning

Here is all my Rust learning experience documented. 
The Main branch is going to include all the Projects that are created during the following of a Tutorial series on YouTube.
The Playlist of the Series can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOMJlQ5B-M0&list=PLVvjrrRCBy2JSHf9tGxGKJ-bYAN_uDCUL).

The other branches are other learning projects. Planed is something using Sycamore or other UI-Based Frameworks.
